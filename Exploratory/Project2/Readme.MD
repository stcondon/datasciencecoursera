Exploratory Data Analysis Project 2
===================================
In this project, we used data on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from the EPA's National Emissions Inventory. From the assignment page:

>Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5.

We got information from 1999-2008, and we were asked to answer a number of questions about the data with plots, some made in base, others in ggplot2.  The questions are as follows:

1. Have total emissions in the US declined over the time period?

2. Have emissions in Baltimore City, MD declined? (A function of the course being taught at Johns Hopkins, but one, as an Oriole fan, I do not shy away from)

3. Of the four types of pollution source listed, which have seen decreases in emissions.

4. Across the US, how have coal combustion-related source's emissions changed?

5. How have motor vehicle emissions changed in Baltimore?

6. Compare Baltimores motor vehicle emissions with those of LA, (yikes!)
